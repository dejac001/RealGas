Simple integration of real-gas effects into open source Chemical Engineering modeling and simulation environments.

In Chemical Engineering and Chemistry, requiring that the energy is conserved with an energy balance
involves calculating the enthalpy of fluids.
For processes involving gas-phases, such those in membrane separations, adsorption separations,
and heterogeneous catalysis, the gas-phase enthalpy is quite commonly calculated
assuming that the gas is ideal and the heat capacity can be approximated by an effective value.
The purpose of this software package is to allow these assumptions
to be relaxed by automating the tediousness of a real gas formulation.
